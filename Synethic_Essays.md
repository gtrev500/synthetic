| **Ultimate objective**                 | *Stand-up a Canvas demo course* that looks like an authentic **English 202 / Critical-Thinking** class so you can showcase **LLM-driven grading & feedback** in front of educators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Core data needs**                    | • **Single assignment → dozens of submissions** (≈ 50-60 each) to make SpeedGrader and rubric comparisons meaningful.<br>• **Rich prompts/instructions** (full paragraphs, not titles) so you can feed them to the LLM to auto-generate rubrics.<br>• Authentic **higher-education essays**—no lorem-ipsum or K-12 true/false tasks.<br>• Optionally: threaded **discussion posts** and existing tutor comments for moderation demos.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Technical questions asked**          | 1. *Where can I find ready-made classroom seeds?* → Canvas `db:seed:demo`, Commons cartridges, OER IMSCC files.<br>2. *Which public essay corpora include many papers per prompt?* → BAWE, ASAP-AES, TOEFL-11, FCE, Persuade 2 .0, MICUSP, etc.<br>3. *How do I regroup BAWE so assignments have multiple submissions?* → bucket by genre instead of file.<br>4. *What corpus best fits college-level critical-thinking?* → recommendation: **MICUSP**.<br>5. *How to reach 50-60 submissions per assignment with rich prompts?* → mix MICUSP, FCE, and down-sample Persuade 2 .0. |
| **Current blockers / concerns**        | • BAWE import left you with **1–3 submissions per assignment**, which underwhelms for demo.<br>• Need to minimize **licence friction** and download delays (prefer datasets available immediately or within 24 h).<br>• Want prompts that are long enough for rubric auto-generation.<br>• Dataset must be **credible to higher-ed faculty** (no middle-school homework).                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

# QUESTION:

Say if I were to simply synthetically generate the essays for analysis, how could I ensure diversity? If I wanted to do a demo on an LLM summarizing the submissions to then generate a discussion post, how would I ensure the LLM generated essays were diverse enough? Will that emerge? Will I need to preform special prompt engineering? Higher temperature? Randomly seeded research via Perplexity?


**Gemini**
Okay, this is a great question and a common challenge when moving from real-world data to synthetic generation for demos.

You're right to be concerned: **diversity will *not* sufficiently emerge on its own** if you simply ask an LLM to "write 50 essays on X." You'll likely get variations on a theme, often converging on the most probable or "average" response.

Here’s how you can ensure diversity for your synthetic essays, especially for the purpose of LLM summarization and discussion post generation:

**1. Strategic Prompt Engineering (The Core of Diversity):**

This is your most powerful lever. Instead of one generic prompt to the LLM for all 50-60 essays, you'll need to create *variations* in the instructions you give the LLM for *each* essay (or small batches of essays).

Think about the dimensions of diversity you want to see in student submissions:

*   **Stance/Argument:**
    *   "Write an essay arguing *for* [topic X], focusing on [aspect A]."
    *   "Write an essay arguing *against* [topic X], emphasizing [aspect B]."
    *   "Write an essay that explores the nuances of [topic X], acknowledging both [aspect A] and [aspect B] but ultimately leaning towards [a specific conclusion or uncertainty]."
    *   "Write an essay that critiques the common arguments surrounding [topic X] from a [specific theoretical lens, e.g., feminist, Marxist, post-structuralist] perspective."
*   **Evidence/Examples Used:**
    *   "Support your argument using primarily historical examples."
    *   "Focus on contemporary case studies to illustrate your points."
    *   "Incorporate (hypothetical or real, if you provide them) statistical data."
    *   "Base your argument on philosophical principles."
*   **Quality & Common Flaws (Crucial for Grading Demo):**
    *   "Write a well-structured, persuasive essay with a clear thesis and strong supporting evidence." (A-grade)
    *   "Write an essay that has a decent argument but suffers from some organizational issues and occasionally unclear phrasing." (B/C-grade)
    *   "Write an essay that presents a weak or unsupported thesis, contains logical fallacies, and has several grammatical errors." (C/D-grade)
    *   "Write an essay that misunderstands a key concept from the prompt."
    *   "Write an essay that relies too heavily on opinion without sufficient evidence."
*   **Tone/Style:**
    *   "Adopt a highly academic and formal tone."
    *   "Write in a more passionate, persuasive, and slightly informal (but still academic) tone."
    *   "Write an essay that is clear and direct, but perhaps lacks sophisticated vocabulary."
*   **Length/Structure (Minor Variation):**
    *   "Ensure the essay is approximately 750 words."
    *   "Include a dedicated counter-argument and rebuttal section."
*   **Specific "Student" Personas (Optional, can be complex):**
    *   "Write as a student who is very enthusiastic but slightly misinformed about X."
    *   "Write as a student who is highly skeptical and challenges the premise of the assignment."
    *   "Write as a student who clearly did the reading but struggles to synthesize it."

**2. Leveraging "Research" (like your Perplexity idea):**

This is an excellent idea to introduce genuine informational diversity.

*   **Seed with Different Information Snippets:**
    1.  For your main assignment prompt (e.g., "Analyze the ethical implications of AI in creative industries"), use Perplexity, a search engine, or even another LLM to generate 5-10 *different* short summaries, sets of bullet points, or lists of arguments/sources related to that prompt.
    2.  For each synthetic essay (or small batch), feed the LLM *one* of these unique information snippets along with your tailored prompt from point #1.
        *   Example: "You are a student writing an essay on [topic X]. Your research has uncovered the following key points: [insert unique snippet A]. Based on this, write an essay that argues [specific stance from point #1]."
        *   For the next essay: "You are a student writing an essay on [topic X]. Your research has uncovered the following key points: [insert unique snippet B]. Based on this, write an essay that argues [different specific stance]."

**3. Temperature and Other Generation Parameters:**

*   **Higher Temperature:** Yes, a slightly higher temperature (e.g., 0.7-0.9) can introduce more randomness in word choice and sentence structure, leading to more stylistic variation. However, if it's too high (e.g., >1.0), the output can become incoherent.
    *   **Use with caution:** Temperature alone won't create fundamentally different arguments or perspectives if the core prompt is too narrow. It's best used *in conjunction with* strong prompt engineering.
*   **Top_p (Nucleus Sampling):** Often preferred over temperature for controlling randomness while maintaining coherence. A `top_p` of 0.9 means the LLM considers tokens that make up the top 90% of the probability mass.
*   **Multiple Generations for the Same "Profile":** Even with a fixed detailed prompt (e.g., "A-grade essay arguing for X using historical examples"), generating it 2-3 times with slightly different seeds or a moderate temperature will give you minor variations that still fit the profile.

**4. Iterative Generation & Self-Correction:**

*   You can ask the LLM to critique its own output or to generate variations.
    *   "Here's an essay on [topic X]. Now, write another essay on the same topic but from a completely different perspective."
    *   "Take the previous essay and rewrite it to include more counter-arguments."
    *   "Identify the weakest part of this essay and rewrite that section to be stronger."

**Workflow for Generating Diverse Essays:**

1.  **Define Your Assignment Prompt:** The one your "students" are responding to.
2.  **Create "Student Profiles" or "Essay Archetypes":**
    *   Archetype 1: Strong argument FOR, uses statistical data, formal tone.
    *   Archetype 2: Weak argument AGAINST, logical fallacies, informal tone.
    *   Archetype 3: Nuanced view, uses case studies, slightly confused on one point.
    *   ... (aim for 10-15 distinct archetypes)
3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Generate Seed Information:** For each archetype or for the main topic, use Perplexity/search to get varied information snippets.
4.  **Craft LLM Prompts:** For each archetype, combine:
    *   The main assignment prompt.
    *   Instructions specific to the archetype (stance, evidence, quality, tone).
    *   (If used) The unique seed information snippet.
5.  **Generate Essays:**
    *   For each archetype, generate 3-5 essays. You can use a moderate temperature (0.7-0.8) here to get slight variations within the archetype.
    *   This way, 10 archetypes x 5 essays/archetype = 50 essays.
6.  **Review and Curate:** Quickly scan the generated essays. Do they exhibit the intended diversity? Are there any duds? Regenerate if necessary.

**Ensuring Diversity for the LLM Summarization Task:**

If you follow the steps above, the essays *will* be diverse enough for an LLM to generate a meaningful summary and discussion post. The summary will naturally pick up on:

*   Different main arguments presented.
*   Common themes or points of agreement/disagreement.
*   Variety in evidence used.
*   Perhaps even common misconceptions (if you engineered them).

The discussion post generated from such a summary can then pose questions like:
*   "Several submissions argued X, while others contended Y. What are the underlying assumptions that lead to these different conclusions?"
*   "Many of you cited [type of evidence]. Are there other forms of evidence that might strengthen or challenge these points?"
*   "A common point of confusion seemed to be [concept]. Can anyone offer a clearer explanation or an example?"

**In summary:** Yes, you absolutely need special prompt engineering. Higher temperature is a minor tool. Randomly seeded research (like your Perplexity idea) is a very good strategy to combine with prompt engineering. It's more upfront work, but it will make your demo far more compelling and realistic.

**How to Use and Extend This Framework:**

1.  **Install Libraries:**
    *   If using OpenAI: `pip install openai`
    *   If using Anthropic: `pip install anthropic`
    *   (etc., for other providers)

2.  **Set API Key:**
    *   **Crucially**, set your LLM provider's API key as an environment variable. For example, for OpenAI:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-yourActualOpenAIKeyGoesHere"
        ```
    *   The script attempts to read `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment.

3.  **Configure Variables (at the top of the script):**
    *   `MAIN_ASSIGNMENT_PROMPT`: Define your core assignment. Make it detailed!
    *   `ARCHETYPES`: This is key for diversity.
        *   Add more dictionaries to this list. Think about different student skill levels, common mistakes, varied arguments, tones, and focuses.
        *   The `instructions` field is what gets appended to the main prompt to guide the LLM for that specific essay.
    *   `USE_RESEARCH_SNIPPETS` and `RESEARCH_SNIPPETS`:
        *   If `USE_RESEARCH_SNIPPETS` is `True`, one snippet from `RESEARCH_SNIPPETS` will be randomly chosen and included in the LLM prompt for each essay.
        *   You can generate these snippets using Perplexity.ai or another LLM, or write them manually to inject specific facts, viewpoints, or common misconceptions.
    *   `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL_NAME`, `LLM_TEMPERATURE`, `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`: Adjust these for your chosen LLM and desired output.
    *   `NUM_ESSAYS_PER_ARCHETYPE`: Controls how many variations you get for each defined archetype.
    *   `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` and `OUTPUT_FILENAME_PREFIX`: Where your essays will be saved.

4.  **Implement `call_llm_api`:**
    *   The current `call_llm_api` function has a **placeholder** for the actual API call, with a basic OpenAI example.
    *   **You MUST replace or complete this section** with the correct SDK usage for your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face Hub, Google Vertex AI, etc.).
    *   Pay attention to whether you're using a "completion" endpoint or a "chat" endpoint, as the request/response structure differs. The OpenAI example shows stubs for both.

5.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

6.  **Review Output:**
    *   Individual `.txt` files for each essay will be saved in the `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`.
    *   A `all_generated_essays_corpus.json` file containing all essays and their metadata will also be created. This JSON file is likely what you'll use for programmatic import into Canvas or further processing.

**To Ensure Diversity for LLM Summarization:**

*   **Varied Archetypes:** The more distinct your `ARCHETYPES` are in terms of stance, quality, arguments presented, and evidence used, the richer the input for your summarization LLM will be.
*   **Research Snippets:** Using diverse `RESEARCH_SNIPPETS` will inject different factual bases or perspectives into the essays, even for the same archetype, further enhancing variety.
*   **Slight Temperature Variation (Optional):** While `LLM_TEMPERATURE` is global in this script, you could modify it to vary slightly per archetype or even per essay if you want more stylistic randomness (but primary diversity comes from prompt engineering).

This framework provides a solid starting point. The quality and diversity of your generated essays will heavily depend on the richness of your `MAIN_ASSIGNMENT_PROMPT` and the thoughtfulness put into defining your `ARCHETYPES` and `RESEARCH_SNIPPETS`.
